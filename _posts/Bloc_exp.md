title: My Bloc Exp.

My Bloc experience has been a mixed bag of emotions. Feelings ranging from the elated joy one feels when finally scratching long-suffered itch, to throwing my computer against the wall.

I've been forced to commit to a grind requiring a mental strength not feasible to me when I enlisted in the developers' ranks. I've found that unconscious rules of programming have etched into mind:

  1. Code must be written, not read.

  2. Talking to yourself is encouraged.

  3. Tests gotta be green.

I've learned, most of all, that problems are solved by attacking from all fronts––not by just plowing ahead. You have a bug in your code? Start by putting everything on the table and working your way backwards. Who knows? You probably forgot to save the file.
