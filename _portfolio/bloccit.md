A reddit inspired application, Bloccit is a social application where people converge over shared interests. Users create a account and have access to an array of topics. Users can create, favorite or up-vote posts for any topic they choose. Posts can be up-voted or down-voted based on users' preferences. Users can also comment on posts that they create or like.
