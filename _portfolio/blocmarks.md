BlocMarks is an application that enables people to create bookmarks for their favorite URLs. Users sign up for a free account, then choose from a list of topics. URLs 'bookmarks' can be created manually or users can send an [email]("postmaster@appb681896280a74e1ca81cbe1a19a36d14.mailgun.org"). Users can also 'like' other users' bookmarks––saving them for later.
